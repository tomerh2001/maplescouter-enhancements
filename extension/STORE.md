# Marketplace publishing

## Automated publishing

The Release workflow calls `.github/workflows/publish-stores.yml` directly after creating a release. This direct call is intentional: a GitHub release created with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger another release-event workflow.

For an existing release, run **Publish marketplaces** from the Actions tab on `main`, with the numeric version and the desired store. It downloads the release assets, compares their files to a fresh build of the release tag, and prepares a source ZIP from that same tag for Mozilla. It never packages uncommitted files or credentials.

Chrome and Firefox run in separate jobs. Chrome uses the v2 API with `publishType: DEFAULT_PUBLISH`, `skipReview: false`, and a 100% rollout. Firefox uses the AMO v5 API with `channel: listed`, includes the source archive on version creation, and adds release and reviewer notes. Both use the existing listings. Store approval remains the store's decision; accepted versions publish without a second manual step.

Firefox also checks the listing's homepage and support URLs, updates stale links,
and reads them back before submitting a package. Rerunning an approved version
can repair these links without uploading the package again. Chrome's separate
listing links must be edited in its publisher dashboard.

Repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Google service-account JSON for Chrome publishing |
| `AMO_JWT_ISSUER` | Mozilla publishing API issuer |
| `AMO_JWT_SECRET` | Mozilla publishing API signing secret |

The Chrome identity is `maplescouter-store-publisher@tomerh-home-server.iam.gserviceaccount.com` in project `tomerh-home-server`. It has no project resource roles; Chrome access comes from the service-account entry in the publisher settings. Chrome grants that identity access to the publisher's items; our workflow pins the MapleScouter item ID. The initial public certificate expires on **September 7, 2027**. Before then, replace it in Google Cloud and update `CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`. Credentials can be replaced with `gh secret set NAME --repo tomerh2001/maplescouter-enhancements` using standard input. Do not put secret values in command arguments or commit them.

The IDs are fixed in the workflow: Chrome publisher `1c6b83a4-2400-48e1-a6c4-dc1923710ec5`, Chrome item `alopdmlliacajfcgnphmojmneanikbdg`, and Firefox GUID `maplescouter-enhancements@tomerh2001.github.io` (AMO ID `3066766`).

Retries first check the store. Published and pending versions are reused, source/notes can be completed after a partial Firefox submission, and a rejected version or a different pending Chrome version stops with an error. Mutating requests are not blindly retried after timeouts. To replace an older pending Chrome review with a newer verified release, run the manual workflow with `replace_pending: true`. It confirms cancellation before uploading. The default leaves other pending reviews untouched, and a newer pending version is never canceled.

Normal releases update the packages, not the listing screenshots or privacy declarations. Update those in the dashboards when the product or its data handling changes. The manual instructions below remain useful for first-time setup and recovery.

# Publishing to the Chrome Web Store

Everything is pre-built. You only need the developer account and the upload clicks.

## One-time setup (~10 min)
1. Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole and sign in with your Google account.
2. Pay the one-time $5 developer registration fee.

## Publish / update
1. Build: `node build.js && node build-extension.js`
   (or download `maplescouter-en-fix-extension.zip` from the latest GitHub release)
2. In the Developer Console: **New item** → upload `dist/maplescouter-en-fix-extension.zip`.
3. Store listing (copy/paste below), category **Fun** or **Productivity → Tools**, language English.
4. Privacy tab:
   - Single purpose: "MapleScouter Enhancements translates maplescouter.com into English, remembers site preferences, and adds a character picker with optional cloud sync of the user's stat presets."
   - Host permission justification: "The extension only runs on maplescouter.com to translate its interface text, persist the user's language/server selection, and manage the character presets of the site's Character page. The only network requests go to scouter.tomerh2001.com, and only when the user loads, uploads or adds a character by IGN or opens the character list (which also fetches that character's public ranking look by IGN), plus the character picture itself from Nexon's public avatar image host."
   - Data usage: the only data transmitted is a stat preset the user explicitly uploads to scouter.tomerh2001.com, plus the IGN alone for cloud checks and ranking look-ups. Declare "Website content" as collected for app functionality only, not sold, not used for unrelated purposes; link the privacy policy (PRIVACY.md on GitHub).
5. Submit for review. First review usually takes a few hours to a couple of days.
6. For updates: bump the userscript @version, rebuild, upload the new zip to the existing item.

## Listing copy

**Name:** MapleScouter Enhancements

**Summary (132 chars max):**
Full English for maplescouter.com, a character picker with looks from the GMS rankings, cloud sync by IGN, history, no ads.

**Description:**
MapleScouter (환산주스탯) is the best MapleStory stat calculator around, but its English mode is missing thousands of translations and it cannot load GMS characters. MapleScouter Enhancements (formerly MapleScouter English Fix) fixes both.

Translation
- About 4,500 missing translations added, with real Global MapleStory terms (Sacred Symbol, Legion, Boss Clear Spec), not machine translations
- About 55,000 official item, monster and map names from KMS to GMS game data matching
- Fixes awkward English the site already had ("Boss Cut", "Doping", "Authentic Symbol")
- Player names and user posts are never changed

Characters (the Character page)
- One list of your saved characters with class, level and HEXA stat; pick one and everything you type is saved into it as you go
- Shows each character's current look from the GMS rankings
- Switch characters instantly, no reload
- Cloud sync by IGN: upload a character, then load it from any browser by typing its name. Nothing is uploaded until you click the sync icon
- The sync icon shows synced, edited since the last upload, cloud copy newer, or conflict, and asks one simple question: upload, load the cloud copy, or replace it
- History: the last 10 saves of each character, restorable with one click
- Overwrite, rename, download or delete a character from its menu (delete local, cloud, or both); import JSON files

Quality of life
- Remembers your language and server (GMS, KMS, JMS, TMS, MSEA), no more resetting to Korean every visit
- Removes ads and sponsor banners
- Tooltips stay open while your mouse is over them

The cloud is public and needs no account: anyone who knows an IGN can load or overwrite it, so do not store anything private.

# Publishing to addons.mozilla.org (Firefox)

The Firefox build is the same code plus a `browser_specific_settings.gecko` block that Mozilla requires. It is generated by `build-extension.js`, nothing is hand-edited.

## One-time setup (~5 min)
1. Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/ and sign in with a Mozilla account (free, no fee).
2. Accept the developer agreement.

## Publish / update
1. Build: `node build.js && node build-extension.js`
   (or download `maplescouter-en-fix-firefox.zip` from the latest GitHub release). Upload the **Firefox** zip, not the Chrome one: the Chrome zip has no `gecko` block and AMO rejects it for the missing data collection declaration.
2. Optional local check: `npx web-ext lint --source-dir dist-extension-firefox`. Expected warnings: `UNSAFE_VAR_ASSIGNMENT` (the script builds its own picker UI with innerHTML from strings it controls) and, if Firefox for Android is ticked, a `strict_min_version` note because Android only gained the consent key in 142.
3. In the Developer Hub: **Submit a New Add-on** → **On this site** (listed distribution) → upload `dist/maplescouter-en-fix-firefox.zip`. Firefox on Android can stay unticked; the site is a desktop calculator.
4. Source code: choose **Yes** (build.js generates msfix-data.js, which counts as machine-generated) and upload a source archive: `git archive --format=zip -o maplescouter-en-fix-source.zip HEAD -- src data build.js build-extension.js extension/manifest.json extension/icons README.md BUILD.md PRIVACY.md LICENSE`. BUILD.md holds the step-by-step build instructions AMO asks for. Put the reviewer note below in the "Notes to Reviewer" box.
5. Listing: name, summary and description below; categories **Games & Entertainment** (primary) and **Other**; support site https://github.com/tomerh2001/maplescouter-enhancements/issues; license **MIT License**; privacy policy: paste the text of PRIVACY.md (AMO wants the text, not a link).
6. Submit. First review of a listed add-on usually takes a few days.
7. For updates: bump the userscript @version, rebuild, then **Upload New Version** on the existing listing with the new Firefox zip.

## Data collection declaration (manifest, generated)
```json
"browser_specific_settings": {
  "gecko": {
    "id": "maplescouter-enhancements@tomerh2001.github.io",
    "strict_min_version": "140.0",
    "data_collection_permissions": {
      "required": ["websiteContent"]
    }
  }
}
```
- `websiteContent` is the honest choice: the stat preset the user uploads is text typed into the site's form, and the IGN is a game name shown on the site. Both go to scouter.tomerh2001.com only when the user clicks Upload, Add or Load, plus IGN-only checks and the ranking look-up described in PRIVACY.md. Nothing else leaves the browser and there is no analytics, so no other data type applies. `none` is not allowed because some data can reach our server.
- It is `required` rather than `optional` because the extension has no runtime opt-in flow (`permissions.request()`); the user's opt-out is simply never uploading.
- `strict_min_version` 140.0: `"world": "MAIN"` in `content_scripts` (needed to patch the site's own JavaScript) works from Firefox 128, but the data collection consent dialog only exists from Firefox 140, and `web-ext lint` warns if the minimum is lower. Firefox 140 is also the current ESR line.
- The `id` is fixed; changing it would make AMO treat the upload as a different add-on.

## Reviewer note (paste into "Notes to Reviewer")
msfix-data.js is not minified or obfuscated code: it is generated by `node build.js` from the JSON translation tables in the `data/` folder of the public repository (https://github.com/tomerh2001/maplescouter-enhancements), and the file is just those tables assigned to a global. The repository is the full source; `node build.js && node build-extension.js` reproduces this exact zip.
