# Building MapleScouter Enhancements from source

These steps reproduce the exact packages that are published (Chrome Web Store zip, Firefox zip, Tampermonkey userscript).

## Requirements
- Node.js 20 (any 20.x; no npm packages are needed for the build, only Node built-ins)
- The `zip` command line tool (preinstalled on macOS and most Linux distributions)
- macOS or Linux shell

## Steps
```bash
node build.js            # bundles data/*.json into dist/msfix-data.js and stamps the userscript header into dist/maplescouter-en-fix.user.js
node build-extension.js  # writes dist-extension/ (Chrome) and dist-extension-firefox/ (Firefox) and zips both into dist/
```

Outputs:
- `dist/maplescouter-en-fix-extension.zip` (Chrome)
- `dist/maplescouter-en-fix-firefox.zip` (Firefox; same files plus the `browser_specific_settings.gecko` block that `build-extension.js` adds to the manifest)
- `dist/maplescouter-en-fix.user.js` and `dist/msfix-data.js` (Tampermonkey)

## What is generated

If the host has no `zip` command and its operating system does not support
installing packages, run the normal build inside a disposable container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work \
  -e BUILD_UID="$(id -u)" -e BUILD_GID="$(id -g)" node:20-alpine sh -c \
  'apk add --no-cache zip su-exec >/dev/null && su-exec "$BUILD_UID:$BUILD_GID" sh -c "node build.js && node build-extension.js"'
```

The container installs its own dependencies and writes the build outputs as the
checkout owner. It does not install packages on the host.

- `scripts/translation-overrides.cjs` applies reviewed `data/overrides/*.json` entries after the original tables. This helper is included in the reviewer source archive.
- `msfix-data.js` is `window.__MSFIX_DATA__ = {...}`: the JSON translation tables from `data/` (i18n patch, dictionary, regex rules, CSS fixes) assigned to one global. It is data, not transpiled or minified code.
- `maplescouter-en-fix.js` inside the extension is `src/maplescouter-en-fix.user.js` with the `==UserScript==` header removed. Nothing else is transformed.
- `manifest.json` is `extension/manifest.json` with the version copied from the userscript `@version`, plus the gecko block for the Firefox build.

## Focused regression tests

```bash
node --test test/*.test.*
```

These tests cover blocked cloud requests, CORS failures, recovery, independent avatar failures, and preserving a character's region on load. They also cover cloud freshness on page entry, dropdown refreshes, request deduplication, upload races, and relative time units from seconds to years. They use Node built-ins and do not contact the cloud service or change saved characters.

The publishing tests cover both store APIs with simulated responses, including validation errors, retry behavior, source attachment, and automatic publication after approval. They never upload to a real marketplace. The real release packages are verified separately by `scripts/prepare-store-release.py` against a build from the release tag.

Translation tests check numeric values and probability tables, interpolation, GMS skill names, dynamic labels, and language persistence. Audit dependencies are separate from the dependency-free extension build; see [weekly maintenance](docs/WEEKLY-MAINTENANCE.md).
